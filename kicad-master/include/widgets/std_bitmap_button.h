/**
 * A bitmap button widget that behaves like a standard dialog button except with an icon.
 * Specifically:
 *     * It has a border
 *     * It has no hover/focused state
 *
 * In wxWidgets 3.2 the native button control is used on Mac for wxBitmapButton with or without
 * text.  Said widget has margins that are more than twice what previous versions had.  This class
 * allows our bitmap buttons to match the layout of our SPLIT_BUTTON.
