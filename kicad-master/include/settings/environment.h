/**
 * KiCad uses environment variables internally for determining the base paths for libraries,
 * templates, and other assets that can be relocated by packagers or users.
 *
 * Because setting environment variables is not user-friendly on most platforms, KiCad supports two
 * backing stores for these internal variables: the system environment, and the settings system.
 *
 * We also want to make it possible to change the names and values of environment variables over
 * time with minimal impact to users.  Since most users do not customize these variables beyond any
 * customization provided by the packager for their platform, an easy way to get this possibility
 * with minimal user impact is to just not store environment variables if they match the internal
 * (compiled-in) default.
 *
 * The way environment variables are resolved is (highest to lowest priority):
 *
 * 1) Variables set at runtime via the Configure Paths dialog
 * 2) Variables set in the system environment
 * 3) Variables loaded from the settings system (stored in COMMON_SETTINGS)
 *
 * For all KiCad system variables, we allow users to change the values at runtime via the Configure
 * Paths dialog.  If these variables were set in the system environment, we do not persist any
 * changes made at runtime (and warn the user about this).  If the variables were not set in the
 * environment (meaning they were either the default value, or loaded from the settings system),
 * we persist the changes via the settings system.  Any variables that match the internal default
 * are not saved in the settings, so that the internal defaults can be changed and the change will
 * not be overridden by an old value cached in the settings file.

/**
 * A simple helper class to store environment variable definitions and values.  This is used to
 * initialize the environment variables that are built-in to KiCad, and also to store any variables
 * created by the user.
