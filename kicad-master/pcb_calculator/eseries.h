/**
 * E-Values derived from a geometric sequence formula by Charles Renard were already
 * accepted and widely used before the ISO recommendation no. 3 has been published.
 * For this historical reason, rounding rules of some values are sometimes irregular.
 * The current list of values is recorded in IEC 60063:2015.
 * Previously it was in IEC publication 63.
 * Although all E-Values could be calculated at runtime, we initialize them in a lookup table
 * what seems the most easy way to consider any inconvenient irregular rules. Same table is
 * also used to lookup non calculable but readable BOM value strings.

// The resistor calculator cannot operate on series larger than E24 due to calculation time

// Values are stored in the 100-999 decade. This is so that all values are integers
// and can be stored precisely. If the values are real values with a fraction part then
// the fractional part is typically imprecisely stores. In the 100 decade the values
// can be stored as precise values in integers. If used in floating point types
// they are as precise as before

// If you want the values in the first decade then simply divide every value in
// the list by the first value in the list.

// E96 is a proper subset of E192. It is every 2nd value. E48 is every 4th value of E192.
// That is, all the series with 3 significant figures are subsets of the same series, E192.

// E24 is not a subset of E48 or E192. All series below E48 have only 2 significant figures
// and are differently from the series with 3 significant figures.

// E12, E6 and E3 are proper subsets of E24. Specifically they are evenly spaced
// values selected from E24. E12 is every 2nd value, E6 every 4th, E3 every 8th.

// E1 is not in the IEC standard.

// The value 0 is not present in any series. It does not fit in any decade.
// It must be special cased in any calcuation or method of selection of
// values.
