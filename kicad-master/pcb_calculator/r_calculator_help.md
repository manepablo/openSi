- This calculator finds combinations of standard E-series (between 10Ω and 1MΩ) to create arbitrary values.
- You can enter the required resistance from 0.0025 to 4000 kΩ.
- Solutions using up to 4 components are given.

The requested value is always excluded from the solution set.<br>
Optionally up to two additional values can be excluded in case of component availability problems.

Solutions are given in the following formats:

	R1 + R2 +...+ Rn	resistors in series
	R1 | R2 |...| Rn	resistors in parallel
	R1 + (R2|R3)...		any combination of the above
